# Finplant

Create an admin backoffice using any of the following (or both) or any other React based admin libraries:

- [React Reduction @reduction-admin.github.io](https://reduction-admin.github.io/react-reduction/)
- [React Admin @marmelab.com](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)

To successfully complete this exercise you need a backend server with some data, there are two options:

1. Create a backend from scratch, for example contact book / library / shop or anything else of your choice
1. Use some mock data generator, like [mockaroo.com](https://www.mockaroo.com/), [mocky.io](https://designer.mocky.io/), [sheety.io](https://sheety.co/) or just google `mock data api generator` or something similar

Data requirements:

1. There must be at least three domain objects (book, author, reviews)
1. User must be able to create / edit / delete at least one domain object
1. Authorization must be present (can be faked with localstorage or something similar)

## Submission

Create a Github repository and add a link to deployed app in `README.md` as well.
