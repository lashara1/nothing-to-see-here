You have to complete two exercises. The first one is a simple test of your programming skills. The second exercise resembles your actual job duties and is meant for you to get acquainted with the technologies we are using on a daily basis.

# 1. Exercise
You have to install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) for this task.
You need to create a Console Application that does the following:

 - After that sorts the array in ascending orders;
 - Displays the sorted array on the screen.
