To explain our application process - Our company uses PHP in most of our projects so to complete the application process you have to be able to pass the test which shows that you will be able to work with us in our projects and have at least a basic understanding of PHP. Inviting to interview someone who has no PHP basis serves no point since we can't work together effectively. Completing the Junior Developers test means that you are up to the level of being hired as a part of our team.

But if you wish to try our PWA test, you can find it below:
- Setup SPWA
- Create a /contact-us route (do not use Magento CMS block/page for this)
- Create a contact form there, use GraphQl for data transport, store submitted data in Magento DB.

General notes: you are free to re-use or extend existing functionality, code, styles

Wish you good luck and hope you find this useful!
