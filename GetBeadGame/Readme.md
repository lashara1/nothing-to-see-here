## Goal

To create simple RSS reader web application.

## Requirements

- Application should include following views:

    1. User registration - form with e-mail and password fields + e-mail verification using ajax. 
         - Existence of already registered e-mail should be checked “on the fly” via ajax call when writing e-mail address and before submitting form. 
    2. Login form with e-mail address and password 
    3. RSS feed view (Feed source: https://www.theregister.co.uk/software/headlines.atom) 

- After successful login in top section display 10 most frequent words with their respective counts 
in the whole feed excluding top 50 English common words (taken from here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English) 

- Underneath create list of feed items. 

- There are no restrictions on frameworks (PHP and/or JS) used. 

- When doing this task please apply the best practices in software development. Add commits with your code separately from framework code.

- Please send the code (archive or link to github) and instructions how to set it up once completed.
