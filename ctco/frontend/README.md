## Goal

To develop a small business-form visualisation library.

## Requirements

- Your solution should accept the plain JSON file as input and build the DOM-structure
to ensure a visual result comparable with the sample graphical design. The JSON file contains the logical markup of the business form.

- You should not implement any business-logic, just build the UI.

- You should write this solution with Angular 2+ or React.

## Additional requirements

- Your solution should be capable of downloading the JSON from the given URL
and build the user interface on the fly.
