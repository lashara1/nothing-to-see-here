Good luck!

## Task 1 - API consumption (1 hour)

For this task you will use starter template (you can find it [here](src/task1/)) to skip all infrastructure setup ceremony.

- Choose any public API (http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory is a good resource for finding one).
- Fetch data from chosen API and present it on the page.
- Store received data in state machine.
- Implement another React component that reacts on state changes and outputs number items received from API somewhere on the page.

## Task 2 - Refactoring (30 minutes)

Do you see any improvements that could’ve been done to this [code](src/task2/Parsers.cs)? If you do, take some notes on how you would refactor, clean it up and make and the code more maintainable. If you can provide refactored version of the code in written form - super! The code won’t compile – this is more a mental exercise.

## Task 3 - Cloud (1 hour)

For this task, the underlying cloud vendor does not matter - pick whichever you are familiar with. Feel free to spend a bit more time to read up about serverless functions if you haven't worked with that before.

- Implement a serverless function that triggers on HTTP POST request
- Calculate the size (in bytes) of the HTTP message body
- Create a new message and store the calculated size in the body of the message
- Send out message to any cloud message infrastructure

Can you describe a real-world scenario when you would like to use a serverless solution and cloud message infrastructure?
