## Task 1 (30 minutes)

Take a look at the picture below and come up with suggestions on how this design could adapt to 
different devices (mobile, tablets etc). Things we're looking for is how the layout should change 
and look for mobile users, basic UX things to keep in mind  and other best practices 
when developing responsive websites.

## Task 2 (1 hour)
Choose any public API (http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory is a good resource for finding one). 
Just use frontend code to get the data from the API and present it on a static HTML page (in a semantic way). 
Try and keep it simple and use native HTML, CSS and JavaScript without adding any external libraries and 
frameworks like Angular, React, Bootstrap and similar.

Good luck!
