# TO-DO List

You need to create simple application about To-do list. The application needs to have at least 3 screens and they need to be accessible with react navigation (stack or switch way, it's up to you).
Task can be done in React Native or Expo. Copy-paste without any thoughts from your side are not welcome. Keeping code clean and readable is a big plus. Application needs to work under iOS and Android, web is not necessary. Database or API is not needed, states and storage can be used. If you have time you can add fancy design but simple design will do too.

## Explanations

1. First screen needs to have welcome message, language selection and username. After filling up all fields from first screen you must go to second (First screen is called only first time when app is loaded).
1. Second screen includes list with tasks with possibilities "Add, Remove and Edit".
1. Third screen includes list with already "Complete" to-do's.

## Bonus task

You can select image/avatar for each To-do list.
