Thank you for your time and an interesting conversation! As agreed, sending you a small test task. 
We expect that it should take you no more than 2-3 hours, and if you feel that you could spend more time to make some things better
- you can write about it or discuss it later. Don't stress too much about how much functionality you can code, 
the goal is to have something we can speak about.

If possible, send the zipped project (or a link to a project). If you feel you cannot manage by that time just let me know.

If you have any questions - don't hesitate to ask.

Test task

Create a registration / login form, where the user can enter an email (as login), name and password.

Registration form should have validation on password - at least 6 symbols, should contain at least 1 uppercase letter and a special sign (i.e. !@#$%^&*()_).

After sign up - send a confirmation email “Welcome, <username>”.

After login - save session (i.e. refreshing browser or opening same site in new tab should keep you signed in). Show a welcome message “Hello, <username>”.

For sign in and sign up create your own CUSTOM API (i.e. not standard included in Laravel).

You can use MSSQL/MySQL or SQLite for database. Please, try to keep code readable, comments will be welcome. 
Using REST standards for API is preferrable. It is OK to use any third-party libraries if needed. 
Don’t spend too much time for edge-cases (i.e. error scenarios), we can discuss them separately if needed.

Bonus:
Forgot password functionality. User should be able to enter email and receive a password reset link. T
he link should be valid for 60 minutes. Only the last reset link should be working (if resetting password multiple times)


Thank you!
