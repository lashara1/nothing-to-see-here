The challenge is to create a living breathing homepage from a mockup that has been designed from our design team. 

Please send us a fully compiled working version of the page and a copy of the code. 

You can use javascript libraries, however they should be used where custom code isn’t appropriate. 

All assets can be found in the attached .xd file and here - https://xd.adobe.com/view/cffd8229-5018-4e51-82f0-87f5b18ef0fc-9aae/ (click the code icon in the sidebar)

The site:
●	is a simple design however we expect pixel perfect accuracy. 
●	should function in all modern browsers.
●	should be fully responsive
