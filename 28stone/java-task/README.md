<br>
<p>1. Using <a href="https://restcountries.eu">restcountries.eu</a> create a text data file in JSON format, containing only the
following data about countries in the European Union: name, capital, currencies, population,
area.</p>
<br>
<p>2. Read and process this file with your java program to get the following results:<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>top 10 countries with the biggest population</li>
<li>top 10 countries with the biggest area</li>
<li>top 10 countries with the biggest population density (people / square km)</li></ol></p><br>
<p>3a. Add the ability to consume the data about countries directly from the <a href="https://restcountries.eu">restcountries.eu</a> and
process it (keep the code that processes data from the text file as well!)<br>
3b. Convert your application to Spring Boot application and expose results via REST API</p>
4. Add unit tests<br><br>
