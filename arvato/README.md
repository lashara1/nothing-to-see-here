## Requirements

- With the help of the tvmaze API create a page using HTML/CSS/Javascript that fulfills the following:
    - A start page where the user can search for tv-shows
    - Some kind of search that you see fit which​ lets the user perform a search
        - The user should get a list (with images if available) presenting the tv shows that matches the search query
        - The user should be able to at least view the shows title and description
    - Optional: Present the show’s seasons ​and episodes ​if a show is clicked
- You are allowed to use any HTML/CSS/JS framework as you see fit to create the best possible experience in  the time you have.
- We will look at both your code and design choices - they weight equally. So make sure the code is structured and commented as well as the User Experience is great. Ask yourself what you would expect from a simple application like this.
- We encourage you to use any new (and/or experimental) methods, just tell us preffered browser and any  information/instructions that might be good to know before we’re trying to run your code!
