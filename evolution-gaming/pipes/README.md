# Pipes

Your task is to solve as much as you can of the 6 levels of the game available at https://hometask.eg1236.com/game-pipes/ .

Your deliverable should contain two parts:

a. preferably all 6 passwords from the game

b. Link to a _private_ GitHub repository with the code you wrote in order to solve the game. Give the user 'evo-home-task' (or 'dev-home-task@evolutiongaming.com') access to the repository.

[JS only starts]

It is recommended to use TypeScript (but plain ES6 can also be used). If you want or need to build a DOM UI we prefer that you use React (but if you are not familiar with it, other frameworks or no framework can also be used) or you can use canvas (either 2d or webgl).

Please note that these are only recommendations and you are free to pick what you feel more comfortable working with.

[JS only ends]

Just in case you would enjoy the extra challenge, we are not including any more instructions, however feel free to ask for more detailed description is you feel you would benefit from it.
