# Card Game

## Goal

Develop an algorithm for comparing the strength of Texas Hold'em Hands. A value of
a Texas Hold'em Hand is the best possible value out of all possible subsets of 5 cards from the 7
cards which are formed by 5 board cards and 2 hand cards

Create two working versions one in TypeScript, second in Scala.

## Texas Hold'em

The details of Texas Hold'em hand values are available on
Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em#The_showdown, in particular, from
weakest to strongest:

- High card - the "fallback" in case no other hand value rule applies
- Pair - two cards of the same value
- Two pairs - Two times two cards with the same value
- Three of a kind - Three cards with the same value
- Straight - Sequence of 5 cards in increasing value (Ace can precede 2 and follow up King)
- Flush - 5 cards of the same suit
- Full House - Combination of three of a kind and a pair
- Four of a kind - Four cards of the same value
- Straight Flush - straight of the same suit
  In case of ties the ranks of the cards forming the combinations decide the highest value. In case of
  further ties, the ranks of remaining cards (in the order of the rank) decide the highest value. All suits
  are considered equal in strength.
  When comparing Full Houses, the three of a kind rank comparison is more important than the pair
  rank comparison, for example, QQQ88 > 999KK, KKK77 > QQQJJ and KKK77 > KKK66.
  When comparing Straights, the A2345 straight is the weakest one and the TJQKA one the strongest
  one, for example, 23456 > A2345 and TJQKA > 9TJQK.
  If any of these rules are not clear, please consult the standard Texas Hold'em rules on Wikipedia.

## Requirements

The input is to be read from the standard input in the form of:

```
<5 board cards> <hand 1> <hand 2> <...> <hand N>
```

where:

```
- <5 board cards> is a 10 character string where each 2 characters encode a card
- <hand X> is a 4 character string where each 2 characters encode a card, with 2 cards per hand
- <card> is a 2 character string with the first character representing the rank (one of "A", "K", "Q",
"J", "T", "9", "8", "7", "6", "5", "4", "3", "2") and the second character representing the suit (one of
"h", "d", "c", "s") .
```

The output is to be written to standard output using the format:

```
<hand block 1> <hand block 2> <...> <hand block n>
```

where:

- <hand block 1> is the hand block with the weakest value
- <hand block 2> is the hand block with the second weakest value
- ... and so forth.
- <hand block n> is the hand block with the strongest value
- Each hand block consists of one or multiple hands (each represented by 4 character string with 2
  characters to encode a card, with 2 cards per hand) with equal strength
- In case there are multiple hands with the same value on the same board they should be ordered
  alphabetically and separated by "=" signs
- The order of the cards in each hand should remain the same as in the input, e.g., don't reorder
  `2h3s` into `3s2h`.

```
For example:

Input:
- 4cKs4h8s7s Ad4s Ac4d As9s KhKd 5d6d
- 2h3h4h5d8d KdKs 9hJh

Output:
- Ac4d=Ad4s 5d6d As9s KhKd
- KdKs 9hJh
```

- Your code should read from standard input until EOF is reached, responding with each input line
  with exactly one output line. The program will be tested by piping input to stdin and piping output
  to stdout. Your code should not output extra output to standard output or receive extra input from
  standard input, except as required as per this document.
- The homework can be written in any programming language which can be run on Ubuntu Linux and
  should include a "ReadMe.md" file with documentation on how to compile and run it, as well as
  install any prerequisites. The documentation should be in English.

## Additional requirements

- Implement the algorithm using Scala, and/or
- Implement a command line switch `--omaha` which uses 8 character strings representing 4 cards
  for each hand and evaluating hand values according
  to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_hold_%27em rules,
- In case the input line is invalid, output a clear & easy to understand error message.

## Keep in mind

- If you find this task too challenging, partial credit will be given for partial solutions. In this case,
  please make sure "ReadMe.md" clearly documents all known limitations of your solution.
- A complete solution in a non-Scala language will be preferred to an incomplete solution in Scala.
- Yielding correct results is more important than the algorithmic complexity of the solution.
- Please publish the solution in a private GitHub repository and give user evo-home-task (e-mail devhome-task@evolutiongaming.com) access to the repository.
