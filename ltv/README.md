## Task

Prepare an application form in which the following information can be entered:

- name and surname;
- full date of birth (day, month, year)
- add one image (jpg, png)

Add validation rules to check:

- whether the person is at least 18 years old at the time of data submission;
- whether a file is attached and is an image file
- whether the field "name, surname" is filled in

Save the processed data as a JSON file, including a reference to the name of the saved file.

Any freely available (free of charge) frameworks and packages can be used to develop the code by placing simplified startup / installation instructions in the readme file.

## What will be evaluated

- the type of data processing chosen
- code structure and arrangement
- code comments and documentation
- the visual presentation of the application form will not be evaluated
