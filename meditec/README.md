## Goal

To create a modular calculator: a calculator to which additional functionality could be added without rebuilding.

## Requirements

- It is desirable to perform the task on the .NET platform (there are no restrictions for implementation, it can be creative).
- The quality of the code, the chosen solution and the implementation will be evaluated. 
- You are also interested in how much has been done in 4 hours (respectively, the task cannot be completed in 4 hours, but we are interested in how much has been done in this time), you may not spend more time, but you should be able to tell how the task would be done next.
